This is the repository I used during the Harvard CS50 course

It includes my personal implementations of problem sets and projects across several core areas of computer science:

 * Data Structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.)
 * Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion)
 * C Programming (memory management, pointers, file I/O)
 * Python (data parsing, scripting, automation)
 * JavaScript (DOM, functions, frontend logic)
 * SQLite (SQL queries, data analysis with SQL)
